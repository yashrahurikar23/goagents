# 🎯 GoAgents Project Vision

**The definitive AI agent framework for Go developers**

---

## 🌟 Mission Statement

**To provide Go developers with a production-ready, idiomatic, and comprehensive framework for building AI agents that rival the capabilities of Python frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex, while embracing Go's philosophy of simplicity, performance, and type safety.**

---

## 🎨 Core Philosophy

### 1. **Go-First, Not Python Port**

We don't simply port Python frameworks to Go. Instead, we:
- ✅ Embrace Go idioms (interfaces, functional options, unexported fields)
- ✅ Leverage Go's strengths (concurrency, type safety, performance)
- ✅ Follow Go conventions (naming, error handling, testing)
- ✅ Build for Go developers, by Go developers

**Example:**
```go
// ✅ Idiomatic Go with functional options
agent := agent.NewReActAgent(llm,
    agent.WithMaxIterations(10),
    agent.WithVerbose(true),
)

// ❌ Not Python-style forced keyword arguments
agent := agent.NewReActAgent(llm, max_iterations=10, verbose=True)
```

### 2. **Simplicity Over Complexity**

- ✅ Clear, understandable APIs
- ✅ Sensible defaults
- ✅ Optional complexity for advanced users
- ✅ Comprehensive examples
- ✅ Excellent error messages

**Philosophy:** "Make simple things easy, and complex things possible"

### 3. **Production-Ready from Day One**

- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (80%+ goal)
- ✅ Error handling at every level
- ✅ Context cancellation support
- ✅ Timeouts and retries
- ✅ Observability hooks
- ✅ Performance benchmarks

### 4. **Vendor Independence**

- ✅ Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, local)
- ✅ Provider-agnostic interfaces
- ✅ Easy to add new providers
- ✅ No lock-in to specific vendors

### 5. **Extensibility**

- ✅ Interface-based design
- ✅ Easy to create custom tools
- ✅ Easy to create custom agents
- ✅ Plugin-friendly architecture

## 🚫 What GoAgents Is NOT

We explicitly choose NOT to be:

### ❌ Not a Python Port
- We don't replicate Python frameworks' APIs
- We don't follow Python conventions
- We build Go-native solutions

### ❌ Not Research-Focused
- We prioritize production readiness over cutting-edge research
- We implement proven patterns, not experimental ones
- Research can happen in separate projects

### ❌ Not UI-First
- We're a library/framework, not an application
- We don't provide web UIs or GUIs
- Users build their own interfaces on top

### ❌ Not Trying to Be Everything
- We focus on agent frameworks
- We integrate with, not replace, specialized tools
- We delegate to best-of-breed solutions (vector DBs, embeddings, etc.)
