### File Operations Tool (1 file)
7. **tools/file.go** (~600 lines commented)
   - **Security-critical comments** explaining 5 layers of protection:
     1. Base directory enforcement
     2. Path traversal prevention
     3. File size limits
     4. Read-only mode
     5. Safe permissions
   - Each operation's security rationale
   - validatePath() detailed defense-in-depth explanation
   - Business logic for all 7 operations (read, write, append, list, exists, delete, info)

## Comment Quality Standards

### Package-Level Documentation
All packages now include comprehensive headers with:
- **PURPOSE:** What the package does
- **WHY THIS EXISTS:** The problem it solves
- **KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:** Major architectural choices and their rationale
- **API STRUCTURE/METHODS:** Overview of available functionality

### Type-Level Comments
All types include:
- **WHY:** Explanation of design rationale
- **Structure decisions:** Why fields are pointers, arrays, or specific types
- **Business rules:** Domain logic encoded in the type

### Function/Method Comments
All significant functions include:
- **WHY THIS WAY:** Rationale for the implementation approach
- **BUSINESS LOGIC:** Key rules and workflows
- **SECURITY:** Critical security considerations (especially in file.go)
- **WHEN TO USE:** Guidance for developers

### Field-Level Comments
Non-obvious fields include:
- **WHY:** Explanation of why this field exists
- **Design rationale:** Type choice, optionality, default values

## Security Documentation Highlights

The File Operations Tool (tools/file.go) received special attention due to its security-critical nature:

1. **Multi-Layer Defense Documentation**
   - Each security layer explained with examples of attacks prevented
   - Defense-in-depth strategy made explicit

2. **validatePath() Deep Dive**
   - 4 security layers documented with attack examples
   - Each layer's purpose and failure modes explained
   - Critical nature of function emphasized

3. **Operation Security**
   - Each operation's security checks documented
   - Safe defaults explained (file permissions, directory creation)
   - Attack prevention strategies made clear

4. **Configuration Safety**
   - Security implications of each option explained
   - Principle of least privilege guidance included
   - Default security posture documented

## Verification

### Tests
- ✅ All 21 file tool tests passing
- ✅ All tools package tests passing (45 tests total)
- ✅ No compilation errors introduced

### Build
- ✅ `go build ./llm/anthropic` - Success
- ✅ `go build ./llm/gemini` - Success  
- ✅ `go build ./tools` - Success

### Quality
- ✅ All comments follow code-comments-guidelines.md
- ✅ Focus on WHY, not WHAT
- ✅ Explain rationale, design decisions, business rules
- ✅ Security considerations well-documented
- ✅ Avoid repetition and obviousness

## Impact

### Developer Experience
- **Reduced Onboarding Time:** New contributors can understand design decisions without reading commit history
- **Better Maintenance:** Future maintainers understand WHY code exists, not just WHAT it does
- **Security Awareness:** Security rationale is explicit, reducing accidental vulnerabilities

### Code Quality
- **Documentation-Driven Review:** Comments make it easier to spot design issues
- **Explicit Trade-offs:** Design decisions and their trade-offs are documented
- **Improved APIs:** Clear explanation of when to use each option/method

### Security
- **Defense-in-Depth Understanding:** Multiple security layers clearly explained
- **Attack Prevention:** Common attacks and prevention strategies documented
- **Safe Defaults:** Rationale for secure defaults made explicit

## Lines Added

- **Anthropic types.go:** ~75 lines of comments
- **Anthropic options.go:** ~60 lines of comments
- **Anthropic client.go:** ~120 lines of comments
- **Gemini types.go:** ~90 lines of comments
- **Gemini options.go:** ~50 lines of comments
- **Gemini client.go:** ~150 lines of comments
- **File tool:** ~200 lines of comments

**Total:** ~745 lines of comprehensive, WHY-focused documentation

## Guidelines Followed

All comments adhere to `.github/prompts/code-comments-guidelines.md`:

✅ **Primary Rule:** Explain WHY, not WHAT  
✅ **Module-Level Docs:** PURPOSE, WHY THIS EXISTS, KEY DESIGN DECISIONS  
✅ **Method-Level Docs:** WHY THIS WAY, BUSINESS LOGIC, WHEN TO USE  
✅ **Focus Areas:** Design decisions, business rules, performance trade-offs  
✅ **Avoid:** Repetitive comments, obvious explanations, implementation minutiae

## Next Steps

This documentation enhancement completes the code commenting task. The codebase now has:
- Clear architectural documentation at package level
- Explicit design rationale at type level
- Comprehensive method documentation with usage guidance
- Security-critical code with detailed defense explanations

Future work can focus on:
1. Maintaining this standard for new code
2. Adding comments to older modules as they're updated
3. Using comments as basis for external documentation
4. Incorporating comment quality checks in CI/CD

## Summary

Successfully enhanced 7 production modules with 745 lines of comprehensive, WHY-focused documentation following project guidelines. All tests passing, no errors introduced, and security-critical code now has detailed defense-in-depth explanations. This documentation will significantly improve maintainability, security awareness, and developer onboarding.
