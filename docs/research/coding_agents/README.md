# Coding Agents Research

This directory contains research and analysis of existing coding agent implementations, architectures, and best practices. The goal is to understand how to build effective code-writing agents using the GoAgents framework.

## Overview

Coding agents are AI systems that can autonomously write, modify, test, and debug code. They leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand requirements, plan implementations, and execute programming tasks.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Coding Agent?

A coding agent is an AI system that:
1. **Understands** natural language descriptions of coding tasks
2. **Plans** the implementation strategy
3. **Executes** by writing/modifying code files
4. **Tests** the generated code
5. **Iterates** based on feedback until the task is complete

### Core Components

All successful coding agents share these components:

1. **LLM Backend**: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.
2. **Tool System**: Functions to interact with the filesystem and environment
3. **Planning Strategy**: Upfront planning vs. iterative planning
4. **Context Management**: Handling code context within token limits
5. **Execution Loop**: Iterative agent loop with feedback

### Common Tools

Coding agents typically need:
- **File Operations**: Read, write, list, delete files
- **Code Execution**: Run scripts/tests to verify functionality
- **Code Analysis**: Parse code structure, extract functions/classes
- **Context Retrieval**: Vector embeddings for large codebases
- **Version Control**: Git operations (optional)

   - Focus: Practical implementation using Gemini API
   - Approach: Iterative function calling with minimal planning

   - Focus: Data Science tasks, production considerations
   - Approach: Comparison of planning strategies and context management

## Key Findings

### What Works
- ✅ Specialized roles (Planner, CodeWriter, TestWriter, Reviewer)
- ✅ Function calling with clear tool definitions
- ✅ Few-shot prompting for structured outputs
- ✅ Working directory scoping for security
- ✅ Iterative loops with feedback
- ✅ Token/cost monitoring

### Common Challenges
- ❌ Context length limits (especially with large codebases)
- ❌ Outdated knowledge (models trained on old data)
- ❌ Infinite loops in planning
- ❌ Cost of many iterations
- ❌ Incorrect tool selection
- ❌ Invalid structured outputs (malformed JSON)

## Implementing with GoAgents

GoAgents already provides the foundation for building coding agents:

### Already Available
- ✅ **ReAct Agent**: For iterative reasoning and action
- ✅ **Function Agent**: For function calling workflows
- ✅ **File Operations Tool**: Secure file operations with safety features
- ✅ **Multiple LLM Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama

### What You Can Build
- Code generation agents
- Bug fixing agents
- Refactoring agents
- Test generation agents
- Documentation generators
- Code review assistants

See `05_GOAGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed examples.

## Next Steps

1. Read the detailed architecture patterns in `01_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md`
2. Study specific implementations in `02_FREECODECAMP_APPROACH.md` and `03_DEEPSENSE_APPROACH.md`
3. Review the comparative analysis in `04_COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS.md`
4. Follow the implementation guide in `05_GOAGENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
5. Apply best practices from `06_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
