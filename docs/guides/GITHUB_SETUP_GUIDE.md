# 🔧 GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Creating Your Public Repository

### Option 1: Convert Existing Private Repo to Public (Recommended if you already have a repo)

1. Go to: https://github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents/settings
2. Scroll down to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change repository visibility"**
4. Select **"Make public"**
5. Type `yashrahurikar/goagent` to confirm
6. Click **"I understand, change repository visibility"**

### Option 2: Create New Public Repository (If starting fresh)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `goagent`
3. **Description:** `Production-ready AI agent framework for Go with OpenAI and Ollama support`
4. **Visibility:** ✅ **Public** (IMPORTANT!)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

Then push your code:
```bash
cd /Users/yashrahurikar/yash/projects/tweeny/agentspace/goagent

# If new repo, add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents.git

# Push code
git push -u origin develop

# Push tags
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

☐ Wikis (not needed initially)
☐ Issues ✅ ENABLE THIS (for bug reports)
☐ Sponsorships (optional)
☐ Projects (optional)  
☑️ Preserve this repository (optional, for important repos)
☐ Discussions ✅ ENABLE THIS (for Q&A)
```

**Topics/Tags (Add these for discoverability):**

### 2. Branches Settings

Go to: **Settings → Branches**

**Default branch:** 
- Keep `main` or `develop` (your choice)
- Recommendation: Use `main` for releases, `develop` for active development

**Branch protection rules (for `main` branch):**
```
☑️ Require a pull request before merging
  ☑️ Require approvals: 1 (if you have collaborators)
  ☐ Dismiss stale pull request approvals
  ☐ Require review from Code Owners

☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
  ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging

This ensures release tags like `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0` can't be accidentally deleted.

### 4. Actions Settings (CI/CD)

Go to: **Settings → Actions → General**

```
☑️ Allow all actions and reusable workflows

Workflow permissions:
  ◉ Read and write permissions

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Add Badges to README
```markdown
[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.22%2B-00ADD8?style=flat&logo=go)](https://go.dev/)
[![Tests](https://github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents/actions)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/yashrahurikar23/goagents)
```

### 2. Create a GitHub Profile README
If you don't have one, create a repo named `yashrahurikar` (same as your username) with a README.md to showcase your projects.

### 3. Star Your Own Repo
Sounds silly, but it gives social proof and shows up in your GitHub profile!

### 4. Pin the Repo
Go to your GitHub profile → Customize your pins → Select `goagent`
