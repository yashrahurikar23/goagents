## 🏗️ Agent Architecture Types

### 1. **Function Calling Agent** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Pattern:** Direct tool invocation via LLM function calling

**How it Works:**
```
User Input → LLM with tools → Tool Call Request → Execute Tools → LLM with Results → Final Answer
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses OpenAI's native function calling API
- Automatic tool selection by LLM
- Multi-turn conversations with tool execution loop
- No explicit reasoning shown to user

**Best For:**
- Tasks requiring precise tool execution
- OpenAI/GPT models
- Production applications (most reliable)
- When you want LLM to decide tool usage

**Implementation (goagent):**
- ✅ `agent/function.go` - 368 lines
- ✅ `agent/function_test.go` - 11 tests passing
- ✅ Tool registry, execution loop, conversation history
- ✅ Max iteration protection
- ✅ Error handling for missing tools, invalid arguments

**Example Usage:**
```go
client := openai.New(openai.WithAPIKey("sk-..."))
agent := agent.NewFunctionAgent(client)

// Add tools
calc := tools.NewCalculator()
agent.AddTool(calc)

// Run agent
response, _ := agent.Run(ctx, "What is 25 * 4 + 100?")
fmt.Println(response.Content) // "The result is 200"
```

### 2. **ReAct Agent** (Reasoning + Acting)

**Pattern:** Interleaves thinking and acting steps

**How it Works:**
```
User Input → Thought (reasoning) → Action (tool) → Observation (result) → Thought → ... → Answer
```

**Key Features:**
- Explicit reasoning trace
- LLM explains its thinking
- Works with any LLM (prompt-based, not API-specific)
- More transparent but slower

**Best For:**
- Complex problem solving requiring reasoning
- Debugging (see agent's thought process)
- Non-OpenAI models (Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)
- Research and exploration

**Reasoning Loop Example:**
```
Thought 1: I need to calculate 25 * 4 first
Action 1: calculator(operation="multiply", a=25, b=4)
Observation 1: 100

Thought 2: Now I need to add 100 to that result
Action 2: calculator(operation="add", a=100, b=100)
Observation 2: 200

Thought 3: I have the final answer
Final Answer: The result of 25 * 4 + 100 is 200
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- `agent/react.go` - ReAct agent with thought loop
- Thought/Action/Observation parsing
- Max iteration control
- Reasoning trace export
- Works with any LLM

---

### 3. **Conversational Agent** (Memory + Context)

**Pattern:** Maintains long conversation history with memory management

**How it Works:**
```
User Input 1 → Response 1 → [saved to memory]
User Input 2 → [recalls memory] → Response 2 → [saved to memory]
...continues with full context...
```

**Key Features:**
- Maintains conversation history
- Memory windowing (keeps recent N messages)
- Memory summarization (compress old conversations)
- Session management
- Streaming support

**Best For:**
- Chatbots
- Customer support agents
- Long conversations
- Personalized assistants

**Memory Strategies:**
1. **Windowing:** Keep last N messages (simple, fast)
2. **Summarization:** Compress old messages into summaries (context-efficient)
3. **Selective:** Keep important messages (tool calls, key facts)

**Implementation Plan:**
- `agent/conversational.go`
- Configurable memory strategies
- Session persistence
- Streaming responses
- Token usage optimization

---

### 4. **Multi-Agent Coordinator** (Hierarchical)

**Pattern:** Manager agent delegates to specialist agents

**How it Works:**
```
User Input → Manager Agent → [Analyzes task]
                ↓
    ┌───────────┴──────────┐
    ↓                      ↓
Code Agent          Research Agent
    ↓                      ↓
[Writes code]       [Finds info]
    ↓                      ↓
    └──────────┬───────────┘
               ↓
        Manager aggregates results
               ↓
        Final Response
```

**Key Features:**
- Manager coordinates specialist agents
- Task decomposition
- Parallel or sequential execution
- Result aggregation

**Best For:**
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Domain-specific expertise
- Parallel processing
- Large projects

**Example Scenario:**
```
User: "Build a web scraper and analyze the data"

Manager decides:
1. WebScraperAgent → scrapes data
2. DataAnalystAgent → analyzes scraped data
3. ReportAgent → generates report

Manager aggregates all results
```

**Implementation Plan:**
- `agent/coordinator.go`
- Task delegation strategy
- Agent selection logic
- Result aggregation
- Error handling

---

### 5. **Collaborative Multi-Agent** (Peer-to-Peer)

**Pattern:** Multiple agents work together as equals

**How it Works:**
```
Agent 1 (Researcher) → Shares findings
         ↓
Agent 2 (Analyst) → Builds on findings
         ↓
Agent 3 (Writer) → Creates final output

All agents can communicate with each other
```

**Key Features:**
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Shared workspace/context
- Collaborative problem solving
- No single manager

**Best For:**
- Creative tasks
- Brainstorming
- Collaborative writing
- Research projects

---

### 6. **Competitive Multi-Agent** (Debate/Critique)

**Pattern:** Agents debate or critique each other

**How it Works:**
```
Proposer Agent → Makes a claim
         ↓
Critic Agent → Challenges the claim
         ↓
Proposer → Defends or revises
         ↓
Judge Agent → Makes final decision
```

**Key Features:**
- Adversarial validation
- Multiple perspectives
- Quality improvement through critique
- Consensus building

**Best For:**
- Decision making
- Code review
- Research validation
- Reducing hallucinations

**Example:**
```
Task: "Is this code secure?"

SecurityAgent: "This code has SQL injection vulnerability"
DeveloperAgent: "You're right, I need to use parameterized queries"
SecurityAgent: "Now it looks secure"
ReviewerAgent: "Approved - code is now safe"
```

---

### 7. **Sequential Multi-Agent** (Pipeline)

**Pattern:** Fixed pipeline of specialized agents

**How it Works:**
```
Input → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Output
      (Extract)  (Process) (Format)
```

**Key Features:**
- Fixed execution order
- Each agent has one job
- Clear input/output contracts
- Easy to debug

**Best For:**
- Data processing pipelines
- Content generation workflows
- Fixed processes
- Predictable tasks

**Example Pipeline:**
```
1. ResearchAgent → Gathers information
2. OutlineAgent → Creates outline
3. WriterAgent → Writes content
4. EditorAgent → Edits and polishes
5. FormatterAgent → Formats final output
```

---

### 8. **Workflow Agent** (Graph-Based)

**Pattern:** Pre-defined execution graph with conditional paths

**How it Works:**
```
Start → Decision Node → Path A
                   ↓
              Path B → Join → End
```

**Key Features:**
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Conditional execution
- Loops and branches
- Visual workflow design

**Best For:**
- Complex business processes
- Approval workflows
- Conditional logic
- State machines

---

### 9. **Autonomous Agent** (Long-Running)

**Pattern:** Continuously running agent with memory and goals

**How it Works:**
```
Initialize → [Set Goals]
    ↓
Loop:
  1. Perceive environment
  2. Plan actions
  3. Execute actions
  4. Update memory
  5. Check goals
    ↓
  [Goal achieved?] → Yes → Done
    ↓
  No → Continue loop
```

**Key Features:**
- Long-term memory
- Goal-oriented behavior
- Environment perception
- Continuous operation
- Task queuing

**Best For:**
- Personal assistants
- Monitoring agents
- Background tasks
- Automation
